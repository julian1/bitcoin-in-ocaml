So have to tx index
  - done - not null on main columns 
  - done - organize with foreign keys first
  - done put unique constraint on tx hash 
  - done add a mapping table between 
  - done rename views to use prefix underscores
  - done - store the sigtype in signature

  - lookup the tx, to see if we already recorded it
  - simplify address storing not to use complicated prepared stmt 

  - record pos, len in output, starting from 0 in tx 
  - maybe same for input 

  - wif

  - move the tx pos, length into the tx_block structure, maybe also add blockdata id... no 
  -  get rid of blockdata? since it's one-to-one with block?  
      - no - because allows non-null enforcement and might be faster

  - ok, there's an issue that tx data might be in block, or somewhere else
    makes it har

---
  change name process_block to store_block ?

  - IMPORTANT should move the transaction isolation begin and commit outside the process block
    so that if want to do other actions - like check if block has been inserted in the same
    tx we can.
