- Need difficulty so that in case of forks - we know the main chain 
- Merckle tree to conform transaction set, is as the block header describes

- get the height included back in.

- manage uxtos - what is the desired outcome? have an index and offset into blocks.dat for each 
	uxto. if they are kept in mem 
		should try just scanning in memory first...

----

we can connect (http/or cli) to examine the read-only structures now, so
it's not really necessary to dump state everytime.

Ok, during runtime
	- blocks go in append-only log
	- leveldb for block and tx indexes - and can be regenerated

- heads should go in leveldb because 
	- writes should be fast 
	- and heads can be created by re-indexing
	- but we need serialization support?

actually we don't need sexp to serialize heads at all. just use

/head/hash1
/head/hash2

- peers are different in that they cannot be regenerated. actually they could
if we retained addr messages...


But what about the heads...
And the initial set of peers...
and the network type?
